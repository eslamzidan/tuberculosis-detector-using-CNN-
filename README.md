# Tuberculosis detection
this task is an image classifier for Tuberculosis prediction. at the end of this task, the model will take a chest x-ray image as an input and predict if this sample of x-ray image is infected with tuberculosis or normal.

# what is Tuberculosis ?
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person.It usually affects the lungs, but can also affect the abdomen, glands, bones and nervous system.

# Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database
You can use the dataset from kaggle from here. https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset

data sets contents of TWO classes ( Normal chest x-ray images and tuberculosis chest x-ray images).

# Note: 
 -The research team managed to classify TB and Normal Chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.3%. This scholarly work is published in IEEE Access. Please make sure you give credit to us while using the dataset, code, and trained models.
